R1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. When you are multiple people working on the repository or you use multiple computers to work on the repository.

R2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A.You want to choose when to update as you may be working on something that should not be updated.

R3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A. 
Forks: copies of repos from one Github account to another Github account. Use so that you can change the contents.

Clones: copies repos either form github to local machine, or from one directory to another on your machine, or between machines.
Use a clone to work offline and/ or to just work locally on your machine so that may people can work on the same repository

Branches: copy of the repos made within the repos as a new commit. Many reasons to branch
